The advent of robust open-source search engines based on RDF and SPARQL query langage, such as virtuoso, allowed us to design this new efficient search system, enabling fine-grained queries, and incorporating many features and constraints not available in classical (lucene-based) query systems.

Opening the sequence space:
Traditional protein databases don't allow queries combining sequence with other criteria, sequences are exposed only to blast or predefined pattern/profile matches (PROSITE, Pfam), therefore queriing both sequence and annotations is a multistep operation, often necessitating a bioinformatician that would download partial results and script on the data.
Thus offering authentic realtime sequence searches with full regex capabiliies allows targeted queries not available elsewhere.
Indirections and inference:
