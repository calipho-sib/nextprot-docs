<a name="01"></a>**Q01. What is neXtProt?**

neXtProt is a comprehensive human-centric discovery platform, offering its users a seamless integration of and navigation through protein-related data.

<a name="02"></a>**Q02. How do I cite neXtProt?**

Please cite one of our publications as indicated in [Citing neXtProt](../about/citing-nextprot).

<a name="03">**Q03. How does neXtProt differ from UniProtKB?**</a>

neXtProt adds more information to the corpus of data on human proteins that is already in Swiss-Prot. In addition to all the data available in Swiss-Prot on human proteins, data originating from a variety of high-throughput approaches (such as RNA-seq, antibodies screens, proteomics, interactomics) have been added to neXtProt. neXtProt data sources are listed in the [Release contents](../about/contents). The version of the data integrated for each source is also indicated. There can be discrepancies between neXtProt and Swiss-Prot as they can be out of sync.

<a name="04">**Q04. Are the isoforms and their sequences in neXtProt different from those in UniProtKB?**</a>

No, we do not currently add any new isoforms in neXtProt. The isoform names and accession numbers are the same as in the human, reviewed entries in UniProtKB, except for the prefix "NX_" in neXtProt accession numbers.

<a name="05">**Q05. What data is found in neXtProt?**</a>

neXtProt provides information about _protein entries_ : their function, relevant diseases and drugs, protein and mRNA expression in normal tissues, direct molecular (other human proteins, non-human proteins, drugs or chemicals) interactants, subcellular localization, sequence features (sites, domains, regions,...), proteomics data, structural data (secondary, tertiary and quaternary), natural and synthetic (SRM) peptides, variant phenotypes, gene and coding exon information for each isoform, protein and gene identifiers. _Cross-references_ to external resources providing additional information are also provided.

neXtProt also provides information on specific topics in its _portals_ : ion channel variants and their effect, variants in proteins involved in hereditary cancers and their effect, and the function of protein kinases.

Citation information and links to the original _publications_ in neXtProt are provided.

Controlled vocabularies (CV) provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval. neXtProt uses a number of controlled vocabularies to describe concepts such as protein families, domains, molecular function, subcellular locations and anatomy. Whenever possible, we provide information for each _term_, including its definition, synonyms, relevant proteins, its relationship with other terms in the CV, as well as the different paths from the controlled vocabulary root term to the term displayed.

<a name="06">**Q06. How often is neXtProt updated?**</a>

There is no regular update schedule; the data in neXtProt is updated several times a year.

<a name="07">**Q07. Is it possible to use your data for commercial purposes?**</a>

Yes, please see the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) [licence page](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) for full details. 

<a name="08">**Q08. How do I know which neXtProt release is online?**</a>

The data release version is indicated in the footer of all our web pages.

<a name="09">**Q09. How can I be informed of updates in neXtProt?**</a>

Updates in neXtProt are described in our [news](../news).

You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nextprot_news) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/neXtProt), where you will be kept up to date with all new releases and changes to neXtProt.

<a name="10">**Q10. What is the difference between curated publications and additional publications in nextProt?**</a>

The publications annotated in neXtProt or any of our sources of data are referred to as _curated publications_. These are complemented by _additional publications_ that have been computationally mapped from other resources to UniProtKB entries by UniProtKB, as well as by community-submitted publications to UniProtKB. 

<a name="11">**Q11. Can I submit data directly to neXtProt?**</a>

neXtProt is interested in large, high quality data sets on human proteins. Please use the Contact option if you have a large data set you would like to submit.

<a name="12">**Q12. Why is my paper not in neXtProt?**</a>

neXtProt is an integrative resource which takes human protein data from a number of different [sources](../about/contents). Depending on the type of data in your paper (function, expression, etc.) you should contact the relevant source as we are not currently doing any annotation. 

<a name="13">**Q13. Do you provide proteins for testing?**</a>

No, we do not.
