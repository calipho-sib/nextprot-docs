<a name="#01">**Q01. What is neXtProt?**</a>

neXtProt is a comprehensive human-centric discovery platform, offering its users a seamless integration of and navigation through protein-related data.

<a name="#02">**Q02. How does neXtProt differ from UniProtKB?**</a>

neXtProt adds more information to the corpus of data on human proteins that is already in Swiss-Prot. In addition to all the data available in Swiss-Prot on human proteins, data originating from a variety of high-throughput approaches (such as micro-array, antibodies screens, proteomics, interactomics) have been added to neXtProt. neXtProt data sources are listed in the [Release contents](../about/contents)

<a name="#03">**Q03. What data is found in neXtProt?**</a>

neXtProt provides information about _proteins_ : their function, relevant diseases and drugs, protein and mRNA expression in normal tissues, direct molecular (other human proteins, non-human proteins, drugs or chemicals) interactants, subcellular localization, sequence features (sites, domains, regions,...), proteomics data, structural data (secondary, tertiary and quaternary), natural and synthetic (SRM) peptides, variant phenotypes, gene and coding exon information for each isoform, protein and gene identifiers, as well as the _references_ supporting the information in neXtProt. _Cross-references_ to external resources providing additional information are also provided.

neXTProt also provides information on specific topics in its _portals_ : ion channel variants and their effect, variants in proteins involved in hereditary cancers and their effect, and the function of protein kinases.

Citation information and links to the original _publications_ in neXtProt are provided.

Controlled vocabularies (CV) provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval. neXtProt uses a number of controlled vocabularies to describe concepts such as protein families, domains, molecular function and subcellular locations. Whenever possible, we provide information for each _term_, including its definition, synonyms, relevant proteins, its relationship with other terms in the CV, as well as the different paths from the controlled vocabulary root term to the term displayed.

<a name="#04">**Q04. How often is neXtPot updated?**</a>

There is no regular update schedule; the data in neXtProt is updated several times a year.
