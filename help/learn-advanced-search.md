#Advanced search

Select the **Advanced** option below the query box to use the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) to access all the neXtProt protein entry data.

The following diagram shows an overview of the neXtProt data model:

A full list of resources and predicates can be found in the [Snorql resource](http://snorql.nextprot.org/help/doc/introduction) to view the details of the underlying **Data model**.

##Query list

We provide a set of sample queries which exemplify the type of searches that can be performed. Feel free to use these as templates for your own queries. These queries, as well as any queries you have saved, are displayed in a pop-up window when first accessing the advanced search. From this query list window, you can:

* **scroll** up or down to browse the sample queries.
* use the pre-defined tags in the drop-down **Tags** menu to retrieve a subset of examples. Start over by selecting *Clear filter*.
* **search** for words in the sample queries by entering these in the search box.

To close the query list window, simply click on the "x" on the top right of the window. This window can be accessed at any time from the advanced search by clicking on the **query list** icon in the search box.

##Managing queries

* **Viewing queries** In the query list window, click on the **eye** icon to view a query, including the comments, explanations and the tags associated with it. Click again on the eye icon to hide the query.
* **Editing queries** Queries must be in the search box in order to be edited.
* **Running queries** In the query list window or while viewing a query, click on the **link** to run the query. If you are entering your own query in the search box, click on Search. As with the simple search, the search results can be sorted and filtered.

##Saving queries

1. Log in. You must be logged in to save and manage your queries.
2. To save a query in the search box, simply click on the **+**. Alternatively, select the **New query** button in the query list window or select **Create new query** while viewing your saved queries.
3. Enter a **Name** and **Description** (optional) for the query.
4. Click **Save**. Saved queries are displayed in the query list window and in [My Queries](user/queries).
