#Download neXtProt

You can download neXtProt data in three ways:

* Click on the **Export entry** icon to the right of the name of an entry from the results of a search or from the contents of a protein list to _download data for a specific entry_. You will be asked to select the format and the sub-part to be exported. 
* Click on the **Download** option above the results of a search or from the contents of a protein list to _download data for all the entries displayed_. You will be asked to select the format and the sub-part to be downloaded.
* Go to our anonymous **[FTP site](ftp://ftp.nextprot.org/)** to download _current and past releases_ of neXtProt, _controlled vocabularies and ontologies_ developed specifically for neXtProt, _report files_ organized by chromosome, as well as other files. Please refer to the [README file](ftp://ftp.nextprot.org/README) for additional information.

The following file formats are available:

* **TXT** Available from the Download option or the FTP site. Text file with neXtProt accession numbers  (e.g., NX_P01308, NX_P06213). 
* **FASTA** Available from the Export entry and Download options or the FTP site. Text file with the isoform sequences for one or more entries. The first line consists of [FASTA header](/help/FASTA-header.md), followed by the sequence on subsequent lines. 
* **PEFF** Available from the FTP site. The PEFF format is an enriched FASTA format that allows mass spectrometry search engines and other tools to easily access data essential to an optimal protein identification, namely sequence variations and PTMs. 
* **JSON** Available from the Export entry and Download options or the FTP site. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
* **XML** Available from the Export entry and Download options or the FTP site. Please refer to the XML Schema for neXtProt (XSD) for information.
