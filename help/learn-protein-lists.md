#Protein lists

A **list** is a collection of protein entries that you have created. 

To view and manage your protein lists, you must be logged in. Log in and select [My protein lists](user/protein/lists) from the login drop-down menu.


##Creating a list

There are three ways to create a list:

1. Select "Create New List". Manually **enter a list** or **upload one or more files** with accession numbers. neXtProt (starting with NX_) and/or UniProtKB accession numbers are accepted. If an invalid accession number is present, an error message is displayed and the list is not created. 
2. Save the results of a query as a list (see below).
3. Combining lists (see Managing lists below).

##Save the results of a query as a list

1. Do a [simple](/) or an [advanced](proteins/search?mode=advanced) search to retrieve a number of protein entries.
2. Select protein entries by either clicking on the **check box** above the results, selecting **All** in the drop-down menu next to the check box or **manually** selecting entries by clicking on the check box preceding the entry name (a check mark indicates the entry is selected). The number of entries selected is displayed. To deselect entries, select **None** in the drop-down menu to unselect all entries or **manually** deselect entries by clicking on the check box preceding the entry name.  
3. Click on **Save as list**. You need to be logged in to save a list. You will be asked to provide a **Name** and **Description** for your list.
