[SCN9A](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_Q15858) (also known as Nav1.7) is a [voltage-gated sodium channel](http://www.nextprot.org/db/term/FA-03722) that is known to play a key role in pain perception. Mutations in SCN9A are a cause of autosomal recessive congenital indifference to pain ([CIPAR](http://www.nextprot.org/db/term/DI-01231)), a disorder characterized by congenital inability to perceive any form of pain, in any part of the body.

In a recent research paper published in Nature ([DOI:10.1038/nature09975](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09975)), a group of researchers from the Universityof Saarland (Hombourg, Germany) reports that 3 patients suffering from CIPAR were unable to sense odors and confirms that SCN9A is normally expressed in human olfactory sensory neurons.

To elucidate how the lack of these channels can cause anosmia, Prof. Zufall and his team studied genetically engineered mice lacking the SCN9A ion channel in their olfactory neurons. They discovered that although olfactory neurons from these mice were able to respond to different odors, they were unable to transmit signals to the olfactory bulb, the smell-processing region of the brain. As a consequence, those mice do not display vital odor-guided behaviors such as innate avoidance toward predator odor, attraction to food, or maternal pup retrieval.

The identification of a sodium channel subunit as a causative gene for a form of congenital anosmia should stimulate research on the genetics of the sense of smell, and new findings on possible links between our main senses and pain.
