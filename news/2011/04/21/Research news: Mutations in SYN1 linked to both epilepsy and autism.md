Synapsin-1 ([SYN1](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P17600)) is a neuronal phosphoprotein that coats synaptic vesicles, binds to the cytoskeleton, and is believed to function in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Mutations in SYN1 are known to be causative of forms of [epilepsy](http://www.nextprot.org/db/term/KW-0887).

A recent research paper in Hum. Mol. Genet. ([DOI:10.1093/hmg/ddr122](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddr122)) which has been commented in a [Science Daily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110408075031.htm) article reports that a group of researchers from the University of Montreal has found a nonsense mutation of SYN1 in all members of a large French-Canadian family suffering from epilepsy. Most of these individuals are also affected with learning disorders and ASD (autism-spectrum disorder). The group also found three additional missense mutations in SYN1 in cohorts of autistic individuals, some of which also suffer from epilepsy. Both the nonsense and the missense mutations in SYN1 lead to a loss of function of the protein.

This study provides evidence that synaptic dysfunction may be a common cause of epilepsy and autism.
