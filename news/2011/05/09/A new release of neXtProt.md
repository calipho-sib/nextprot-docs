We are happy to announce a new release of neXtProt Beta. This release offers new functionalities and also improves on the usability of the platform.

We are thankful to our users for their feedback and their support.

What is new in this release:

**Better searching**

* It is now possible to search in terminologies (ontologies and controlled vocabularies);
* Searches in proteins and publications are now separate options - complemented by the search in terminologies;
* Improved search bar; 
* You can now search by chromosomal location of the protein-coding genes;
* The search "refine" has been replaced by a filtering option;
* It is now possible to choose to restrict searches to "Gold" data or to search on both "Gold" and "Silver" annotations;
* We have added in the search result "Summary" view, the length of the protein (that of the default selected isoform);
* URLs for searches and displayed pages have been simplified and are now REST-compatible.

**Other changes**

* Annotations based on submissions and unpublished observations are now referenced;
* We have taken into account the new protein-centric annotation system from the [Human Protein Atlas](http://www.proteinatlas.org/), changing our quality 'grading' of their expression data. Also, the major redesign of the Human Protein Atlas web portal allowed us to make deep links to their annotation pages;
* We have loaded 'Silver' quality expression data from [Bgee](http://bgee.unil.ch/bgee/bgee);
* The Expression Page now contains a toogle to hide/show "Silver" expression data;
* We have added references to publications relevant to human proteins but not used as evidence for annotations (most of them from [NCBI GeneRif](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/GeneRIF/GeneRIFhelp.html) and [PDB](http://www.pdb.org/));
* We have added links from the 3D structure view to [ProteoPedia](http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page);
* We have added the documentation originating from [PROSITE](http://www.expasy.org/prosite/) or if not available, from [InterPro](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) to the domain terminology pages;
* We now have pages detailing each release's [contents](http://www.nextprot.org/db/statistics/release) and [statistics](http://www.nextprot.org/db/statistics/release?viewas=numbers);
* As you can see (as you are reading this page), we can post news relevant to neXtProt or about [cutting-edge research](http://www.nextprot.org/news/research/archive) on human genes and proteins;

In addition to theses changes and numerous bug fixes, there are many improvements which are "under the hood" and that, while not directly visible to our users, will allow them to experience a much smoother experience.
