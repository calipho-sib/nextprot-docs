Proteus syndrome ([MIM:176920](http://omim.org/entry/176920)) is mainly characterized by asymmetric and disproportionate overgrowth of body parts, and by a particular susceptibility to tumor development. This very rare disorder was brought to public’s attention in the 80’s thanks to David Lynch's film "The Elephant Man", inspired from the life of Joseph Merrick - a severely deformed Englishman discovered performing in a freak show in the ninetieth century.

Since it has never been reported to recur in a family, it has been hypothesized that Proteus syndrome was probably due to a somatic, non-heritable mutation, and not to a constitutive mutation which would certainly be lethal. Somatic mosaic mutations arise spontaneously during embryonic development, and are only present in lineages to which the mutated cell gives rise.

As described in their publication in the New England Journal of Medicine ([DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa1104017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1104017)), Dr. Biesecker and his colleagues from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) sequenced the "exomes" of different patients with Proteus syndrome. The exome is the small part (about 2%) of our genome that contains the sequence information of our proteins. By comparing the exome sequences of affected versus unaffected tissue from the same patients, they discovered that most patients had a single mutation in the oncogene AKT1 encoding the [AKT1 kinase](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P31749/function), a protein involved in cell proliferation. This mutation, which leads to the substitution of a single amino acid in the protein ([Glu17Lys](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_P31749/medical)), was previously reported in some cancers and induces a hyperactivation of the kinase. Once the mutation happens in a cell, local hyperactivity of AKT1 induces the uncontrolled growth of the corresponding tissue.

These new findings suggest that down-regulating AKT1 in affected tissue may be a strategy to cure this severely invalidating condition. This is particularly promising since several AKT1 inhibitors have successfully been developed by pharmaceutical companies for cancer applications.
