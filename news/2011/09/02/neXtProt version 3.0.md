We are happy to announce version 3.0 of neXtProt. This version, launched for the HUPO 2011 World Congress in Geneva, includes data from a number of sources, as well as features and tools addressing the needs of the participants to the [HUPO Human Proteome Project (HPP)](http://www.hupo.org/research/hpp/default.asp).

**What is new in this version**

**Proteomics view**

Protein entries are now linked to a new Proteomics view. This view provides information on MS-identified peptides, positions of PrESTs from the HPA antibody project, PTMs, as well as links to the C-HPP specific project pages. This view will soon be complemented with links to the SRM spectra from the groups of R. Aebersold (ETHZ) and R. Moritz (ISB) when this data becomes publicly available.

**Exports**

Export of data both in XML and in PEFF formats. neXtProt is the first resource to offer support to the [PSI PEFF format](http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/317). This enriched FASTA format allows search engines and other tools to easily and consistently access data essential to the success of HPP, namely sequence variations and PTMs.

**New datasets for post translational modifications**

We have started to load high-quality data sets of PTMs, starting first with N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites.

**New datasets for subcellular localization**

We have integrated subcellular localization results from two different high-throughput projects: [DKFZ GFP-cDNA localization](http://gfp-cdna.embl.de/) and [Weizmann Institute of Science's Kahn Dynamic Proteomics Database](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/DynamProt/).

**FTP site**

A new [anonymous FTP site](ftp://ftp.nextprot.org/) providing data dumps of neXtProt in XML and PEFF, as well as report files organized by chromosome to support the chromosome-centric HPP projects in monitoring their progress toward the initiative. The FTP site also allows to download the neXtProt-specific controlled vocabularies and ontologies.
