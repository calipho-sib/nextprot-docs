Sleep is essential for surviving in all higher animals. Humans sleep approximately a third of their lifetime, and too little or too much sleep was often found to be associated with metabolic or psychiatric disorders. Sleep duration can be influenced by photoperiod and sleep time, and strongly depends on age and gender. However, a genetic component is also strongly suspected since twin studies indicate as much as 40% heritability in individual sleep duration.

A [genome-wide study](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp2011142a.html) conducted in more than 4000 individuals from seven European populations recently published in Molecular Psychiatry allowed to identify a variant in the ABCC9 gene which would explain sleep duration variations of about 5% (i.e. 24 minutes) between individuals.

The [ABCC9](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_O60706) gene encodes a subunit of a potassium channel and is very conserved throughout evolution. It was previously known to be associated with energy metabolism and response to stress, and involved in some cardiomyopathies and cardiac rhythm disturbances. Interestingly, flies devoid of this gene have dramatically reduced night-sleep, due to a delay of its onset by 3 hours. This demonstrates that this gene is relevant for the modulation of sleep in distant species, and could provide clues to understand the complex relationships between sleep and metabolic disorders.
