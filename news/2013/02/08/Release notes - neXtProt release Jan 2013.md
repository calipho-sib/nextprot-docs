**New data**

* We have integrated data from two new resources: COSMIC (variants of somatic origin) and Peptide Atlas (peptide identifications of high quality);
* Updated HPA to release 10;
* Updated Bgee to release 12;
* Continued integration of post-translational modifications.

**Tool for visualization of 3D structures**

The L-MSVM applet, developed by BIONEXT ([www.bio-next.com/](http://www.bio-next.com/)) is available from our 'Structure' view. Users must run the Java applet and select the structure to be displayed. A number of functions accessed using the mouse, such as zooming in, rotating the structure about a specific residue, changing the representation, are possible.

**New on our FTP site**

* Cellosaurus: A comprehensive thesaurus on cell lines, containing cell lines from over 30 resources, including ATCC, IMGT/HLA, CHEMBL, PubMed, MeSH, Brenda, EFO, MCCL, and CLO.
* Files with mappings of neXtProt entries to MGI, HGNC, Geneid, RefSeq, and Ensembl.
* A new file, stats_by_chromosome.txt, file with the following data for each chromosome: Number of genes, number of entries, number of entries with proteomics data, and number of entries with evidence at protein level (PE1).
