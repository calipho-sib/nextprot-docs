Music is universal. It is an important communication tool in human populations, complementary to language. Very young infants are able to process and respond to musical patterns before they can talk, suggesting that musical aptitude is an inborn property of human beings. However, musical abilities such as recognizing music or singing in tune can substantially differ between individuals, from absolute pitch to amusia. Whereas it is estimated that about 40 to 50% of our musical abilities are linked to genetics, the exact genes that may be responsible for musical talent remain to be discovered.

A [genome-wide study](http://jmg.bmj.com/content/49/12/747.long) conducted in a thousand of individuals from 73 families recruited in rural provinces of Mongolia allowed to identify a variant in the UGT8 gene which would explain some differences in their musical abilities. The [UGT8](http://www.nextprot.org/db/entry/NX_Q16880) gene is conserved in all Vertebrates. It is highly expressed in the brain and encodes an enzyme called UDP glycosyltransferase 8, which performs a key step in the production of galactosylceramides (or cerebrosides). These complex lipids are particularly important for the development of central and peripheral nervous systems. The variation that was found to be associated with musical abilities, the SNP [rs4148254](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?type=rs&rs=rs4148254), changes amino acid 226 of the protein from proline to leucine and may affect its enzymatic function.
