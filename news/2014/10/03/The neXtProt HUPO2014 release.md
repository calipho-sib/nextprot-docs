For the [2014 HUPO international conference](http://www.hupo.org/events/hupo-13th-annual-world-congress-madrid-2014-october-5-8/) in Madrid (October 5-8, 2014) we deployed a new release of neXtProt with major data updates of interest to the proteomics community.

Noteworthy is:

- The human complete proteome version of the [SRMAtlas](http://www.srmatlas.org/) is now public and we have integrated the mapping to the nearly 150'000 peptides that are available in this first public release. We show these mapping in our proteomics view and we added a new "feature track" called "SRM Peptide" to display this information.

- Integration of the latest version of [PeptideAtlas](http://www.peptideatlas.org/) (from 2014-07-31), containing over 1 million peptides mapping to 16,635 entries.

- There are now 82% of the entries whose existence has been confirmed at the protein level, mostly thanks to the new proteomics studies that have been re-analyzed and integrated in PeptideAtlas.

- neXtProt has nearly 34,000 post translational annotations obtained from the curation of research articles, and covering several different types of modifications: phosphorylation, N- and O-glycosylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and methylation.

neXtProt is being built as a participative platform and we look forward to receiving users' input for the future development of neXtProt.
