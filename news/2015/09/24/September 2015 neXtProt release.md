This latest release of neXtProt includes:
- An update of Ensembl so that neXtProt entries are now aligned on the most recent version of the reference human genome assembly, GRCh38
- Updates of COSMIC, IntAct, and GO annotations

These updates lead to:
- 310,779 new protein variants
- 5,194 new post-translational modifications
- 604 new protein-protein interactions
- 106 additional proteins are now supported at the protein level

In addition, neXtProt has a deployed a new tool, the Peptide Viewer. That tool which is available via a link on the search result page, "New peptide viewer" allows user to browse through the information available in neXtProt concerning both MS-identified and synthesized SRM peptides. Among other functionalities it allows to see the coverage of a given protein in term of MS peptides and if a given peptide is proteotypic or not.

We look forward to hearing your feedback on neXtProt; contact us at [support@nextprot.org](mailto:support@nextprot.org) with and comments and questions.
