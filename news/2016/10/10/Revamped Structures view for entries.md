The Structures view provides an integrated view of the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure for an entry. In addition to modernizing this page so that it loads more quickly, a number of changes have been implemented to improve usability. 

**Improvements to the graphic feature viewer**

The graphic feature viewer displays sequence features along tracks as a function of their position in the isoform sequence. It is now simpler to switch from isoform by selecting the isoform in the tabs above the viewer. Two new functionalities have been added: (1) the position of the cursor in this viewer is displayed and (2) one can zoom into different parts of the sequence. This is particularly useful when dealing with entries with long sequences for which the initial view shows an empty sequence track.

**New search in the sequence option**

The isoform sequence is displayed with spaces separating each 10-aa stretch for legibility. In order to facilitate searching for a specific sequence of interest in the isoform sequence, a new search in sequence has been introduced which also supports regular expressions (regex).

**New BIONEXT 3D viewer version**

A new version of the 3D viewer is now implemented which no longer requires a plugin to be installed or an applet to authorized. The 3D structure now loads much more quickly and PDBx format files used to represent large structures is now supported. In addition it is now possible to select which chain should be displayed, whether to view all the molecules in a complex structure (context), as well as to rotate, translate, spin, and measure distances within the structure. The 3D structure can be viewed either in stereoscopy or anaglyph, and various other display parameters can be modified.

**3D structure table**

A number of changes have been made to improve the usability of the table displaying the 3D structures for an entry. The content of the table can now be sorted by column â€“ this makes finding the highest resolution structure or which structures cover a particular range of residues easier.
