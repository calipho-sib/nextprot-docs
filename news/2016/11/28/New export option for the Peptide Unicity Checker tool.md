Developed for the proteomics community, the [Peptide Unicity Checker](/tools/unicity-checker) analyzes up to 1,000 peptides from mass spectrometry experiments. It determines the proteotypicity of the peptides, be it with respect to entries or isoforms, using the human protein sequences in neXtProt. This tool is more than just a simple mapping tool - leucine and isoleucine are considered equivalent and known sequence variants can be taken into account.

**New export feature**

Matching entries or isoforms are displayed for each peptide. The new “Download” option allows users to download the data so as to further analyze the results offline. Please note that this option is not functional in all browsers.

**Additional changes**

A number of changes have been made to the user interface so as to improve usability:
* It is now possible to upload a TXT file containing peptide sequences for analysis.
* In order to return relevant results, duplicate peptides are removed and their number reported. Results are reported for distinct peptides only.
* A “Reset” button has been added that clears the form.
