Developed for the proteomics community, the peptide [Unicity checker](/tools/unicity-checker) analyzes up to 1,000 peptides from mass spectrometry experiments. It determines the proteotypicity of the peptides using the human protein sequences in neXtProt. This tool is more than just a simple mapping tool - leucine and isoleucine are considered equivalent and known sequence variants can be taken into account.

**New export feature**

The new “Download” option allows users to download the results in CSV format. Please note that this option is not functional in all browsers.

**Additional changes**

A number of changes have been made to the user interface so as to improve usability:
* It is now possible to upload a TXT file containing peptide sequences for analysis.
* In order to return relevant results, duplicate peptides are removed and their number reported. Matching entries or isoforms are calculated and displayed for each distinct peptide. 
* A “Reset” button has been added that clears the form.
