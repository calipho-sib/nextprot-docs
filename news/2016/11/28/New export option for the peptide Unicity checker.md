Developed for the proteomics community, the peptide [Unicity checker](/tools/unicity-checker) analyzes up to 1,000 peptides from mass spectrometry experiments. It determines the proteotypicity of the peptides using the human protein sequences in neXtProt. This tool is more than just a simple sequence mapping tool as it can take into account the wealth of sequence variants stored in neXtProt.

This release adds an important new feature for this tool, a "Download" option that allows users to download the results in CSV format. (please note that this option is not functional in all browsers)

A number of additional changes have been made to the user interface so as to improve usability:

* It is now possible to upload a TXT file containing peptide sequences for analysis.
* In order to return relevant results, duplicate peptides are removed and their number reported. Matching entries or isoforms are calculated and displayed for each distinct peptide. 
* A "Reset" button has been added that clears the form.
