Abstract

The neXtProt human protein knowledgebase [https://www.nextprot.org](https://www.nextprot.org) continues to add new content and tools, with a focus on proteomics and genetic variation data. neXtProt now has proteomics data for over 85% of the human proteins, as well as new tools tailored to the proteomics community. 

Moreover, the neXtProt release 2016-08-25 includes over 8000 phenotypic observations for over 4000 variations in a number of genes involved in hereditary cancers and channelopathies. These changes are presented in the current neXtProt update. All of the neXtProt data are available via our user interface and FTP site. We also provide an API access and a SPARQL endpoint for more technical applications.
