**Changes to the data**

This last release of the year builds on UniProtKB 2016_10. UniProtKB has updated 107 human immunoglobulin entries which have now been integrated in neXtProt. As a consequence, all UniProtKB Reviewed human entries are now found in neXtProt with the exception of 6 entries - the Ig mu heavy chain disease protein (P04220) and 5 T-cell receptor V regions (P04436 P04437 P01737 P01733 P04435).

This release also includes an update to Ensembl Release 86, as well as updates of COSMIC, IntAct, and the Human Protein Atlas. The release version for each source of data incorporated in the current neXtProt release is found in the [Release contents](/about/contents).

**Changes to the tools**

We recently added a "Download" option to the peptide [Unicity checker](/tools/unicity-checker) which allows users to get the results in CSV format. However this option was restricted to use in the Chrome and Firefox browsers. This option is now also functional in Internet Explorer and Safari.
