**Changes to the data**

This last release of the year builds on UniProtKB 2016_10. UniProtKB has updated 107 human immunoglobulin entries so that they are now mapped to the human genome assembly thus allowing their integration in neXtProt. As a consequence, all UniProtKB Reviewed human entries are now found in neXtProt with the exception of 6 entries - the Ig mu heavy chain disease protein (P04220) and 5 T-cell receptor V regions (P04436 P04437 P01737 P01733 P04435) which are not yet compatible with the current human genome assembly.

This release also includes an update to Ensembl, as well as updates of COSMIC, IntAct, and the Human Protein Atlas. The release version for each source of data incorporated in the current neXtProt release is found in the [Release contents](/about/contents).

The 5 million sequence variant mark has been reached.

**Changes to the tools**

We recently added a "Download" option to the peptide [Unicity checker](/tools/unicity-checker) which allows users to save the results in CSV format. This option is now also functional in Internet Explorer and Safari.

**Changes to the files available by FTP**

The 'cosmosaurus.txt' file containing the mapping of COSMIC disease terms to the NCI Thesaurus has been removed from the FTP file. It is no longer used by neXtProt as COSMIC now uses the NCI thesaurus terms to describe diseases.
