Abstract

Voltage-gated sodium channels are pore-forming transmembrane proteins that selectively allow sodium ions to flow across the plasma membrane according to the electro-chemical gradient thus mediating the rising phase of action potentials in excitable cells and playing key roles in physiological processes such as neurotransmission, skeletal muscle contraction, heart rhythm, and pain sensation. Genetic variations in the nine human genes encoding these channels are known to cause a large range of diseases affecting the nervous and cardiac systems. Understanding the molecular effect of genetic variations is critical for elucidating the pathologic mechanisms of known variations and in predicting the effect of newly discovered ones. To this end, we have created a Web-based tool, the Ion Channels Variants Portal, which compiles all variants characterized functionally in the human sodium channel genes. This portal describes 672 variants each associated with at least one molecular or clinical phenotypic impact, for a total of 4,658 observations extracted from 264 different research articles. These data were captured as structured annotations using standardized vocabularies and ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology and the Ion Channel ElectroPhysiology Ontology. All these data are available to the scientific community via neXtProt at [https://www.nextprot.org/portals/navmut].

##Updated Function view for entries

The Function view provides an overview of the molecular function of the entry, including its enzymatic activity and biophysicochemical properties. The biological processes and pathways in which the entry plays a role are also provided. In addition to modernizing this page so that it loads more quickly, a number of changes have been implemented to improve usability.

_New ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY sub-category_

This new sub-category regroups information concerning the enzymatic or transport activity of the entry. In particular, the (1) reactions catalyzed, (2) transport activity, (3) enzymatic activity regulation and (4) cofactors required are now found in this section.

_Changes to cross-references_

In addition to the cross-references found in the “Further external links” section at the bottom of the page, some cross-references used to be interspersed throughout the section containing annotations. These cross-references have either been converted into annotations or moved to the “Further external links” section.

Cross-references from the following sources have been converted into annotations: (1) TCDB, (2) KEGG, (3) Reactome and (4) UniPathways. The neXtProt data model has been changed accordingly, thereby increasing the information that can be queried using the advanced search.

Cross-references from the following sources have been moved to the “Further external links” section: (1) BioCyc, (2) BRENDA, (3) CAZy, (4) MEROPS, (5) PeroxiBase and (6) REBASE.
