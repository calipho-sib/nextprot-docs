A federated SPARQL query allows a user to search multiple database at once in real time, take the results and present them in the desired form. Examples of federated queries are found in our [Snorql interface](https://snorql.nextprot.org/) with the tag &#34;federated query&#34;. The neXtProt data set can now be accessed online via a SPARQL federated query. Both GET and POST methods are supported. Documentation and examples are provided at [https://api.nextprot.org/sparql](https://api.nextprot.org/sparql).
