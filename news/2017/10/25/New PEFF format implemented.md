The PSI Extended FASTA Format ([PEFF](http://www.psidev.info/peff)) constitutes a standard way to encode protein and nucleotide sequence databases. The Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) has just finished defining the PEFF 1.0 format which we implement in this release. 

“NumberOfEntries” now corresponds to the number of sequence entries in the PEFF file and not the number of neXtProt entries as was previously the case. PEFF files for individual entries can be downloaded from the search results page (for example, [search in proteins for MSH6](https://www.nextprot.org/export/entries.peff?query=MSH6)), when viewing lists or running private queries, as well as from any entry view. Files containing multiple entries can also be downloaded from the search results page. Files with all the entries for a chromosome or in a release are available from our FTP site at [ftp://ftp.nextprot.org/pub/current\_release/peff/](ftp://ftp.nextprot.org/pub/current_release/peff/).
