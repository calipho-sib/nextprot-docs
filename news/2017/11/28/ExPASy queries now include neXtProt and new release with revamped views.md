##Query neXtProt via ExPASy

[ExPASy](https://www.expasy.org/), the SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal which provides access to scientific databases and software tools (i.e., resources) in different areas of life sciences, now includes neXtProt in its cross-resource query system.

##Revamped Proteomics view for entries

The Proteomics view provides information useful to the proteomics community. In particular, this view displays peptides from PeptideAtlas and neXtProt observed by mass spectrometry and SRM peptides from SRMAtlas. It also shows the epitopes recognized by antibodies from the Human protein atlas.

It is now possible to search the positional annotations listed in the feature table for a specific category or for text found in the feature description. For instance, searching for “SRM” returns the number of SRM peptides mapping to the isoform and allows one to rapidly browse the data for all SRM peptides.

##Revamped Identifiers view for entries

Identifiers uniquely identify an entry. The Protein Identifiers and Gene Identifiers views overlapped considerably and have hence been merged for ease of use. Searching for Affymetrix or Illumina microarray probe identifiers returns the corresponding entry. For example, searching for the Affymetrix microarray probe [202911_at](https://www.nextprot.org/proteins/search?query=202911_at) retrieves DNA mismatch repair protein Msh6 (MSH6).
