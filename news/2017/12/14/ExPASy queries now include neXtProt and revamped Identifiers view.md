##Query neXtProt via ExPASy

[ExPASy](https://www.expasy.org/), the SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal which provides access to scientific databases and software tools (i.e., resources) in different areas of life sciences, now includes neXtProt in its cross-resource query system.

##Revamped Identifiers view for entries

Identifiers uniquely identify an entry. The Protein Identifiers and Gene Identifiers views overlapped considerably and have hence been merged for ease of use. Searching for Affymetrix or Illumina microarray probe identifiers returns the corresponding entry. For example, searching for the Affymetrix microarray probe [202911_at](https://www.nextprot.org/proteins/search?query=202911_at) retrieves DNA mismatch repair protein Msh6 (MSH6).
