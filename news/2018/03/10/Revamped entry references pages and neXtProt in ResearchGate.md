##Revamped entry references pages

The references supporting information (annotations) displayed in neXtProt are provided in the pages accessible in the "References" section of the left-hand menu for all entries. References are sub-divided in five categories - curated publications, additional publications, patents, submissions and Web resources - each displayed in a separate page in inverse chronological order. The total number of references for an entry is shown in the yellow badge at the top of the page. For example, cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53)[https://www.nextprot.org/entry/NX_P04637/] currently has a total of 8970 references: 1862 curated publications, 7092 additional publications, 11 submissions and 5 Web resources. These pages now load much more quickly.
