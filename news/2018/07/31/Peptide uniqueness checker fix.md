When a list of peptides containing one or more peptides with no matching sequence were submitted to the [Peptide uniqueness checker](../tools/peptide-uniqueness-checker), no results were returned for the first non-matching peptide and all peptides after it. This issue is now fixed (the pepx program and our [API](https://api.nextprot.org/) handled this correctly). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
