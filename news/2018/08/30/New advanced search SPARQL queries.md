The following queries have been added:

1. [NXQ\_00227](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00227) **Proteins with at least 2 peptides >=9aa found in testis, but with no peptide identified in sperm \[lost during sperm maturation\]**

12. [NXQ\_00243](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00243) **Proteins with a signal sequence**

In addition, the following query has been modified:

1. [NXQ\_00022](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00022) **Proteins with no function annotated**. Three additional unspecific GO MF/BP terms have been included (GO:0046914 transition metal ion binding and GO:0046872 metal ion binding and GO:0035556 intracellular signal transduction).

Our upcoming paper mentions all but the first of the above queries:
