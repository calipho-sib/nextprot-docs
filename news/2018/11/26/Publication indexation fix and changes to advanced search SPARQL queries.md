##Publication indexation fix

Some publications displayed in entry views could not be retrieved when searching in publications. This indexation problem has now been fixed. As a consequence, the number of Cited publications and Manually curated publications in the [release](../about/statistics) is 108253 and 96387, respectively, an increase of 2441.
