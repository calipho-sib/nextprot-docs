##Publication indexation fix

Some publications displayed in entry views could not be retrieved when searching in publications and the number of publications (total, cited, computationally mapped, large scale and manually curated) in the [release statistics](../about/statistics) were incorrect. This problem has now been fixed.

##Advanced search SPARQL queries

The following query has been added:

1. [NXQ\_00245]( ../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00245) **Proteins with a propeptide**

The following query which returned an error has been fixed:

1. [NXQ\_00141]( ../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00141) **Human proteins highly expressed in brain and observed in a PDB structure involving a virus protein**
