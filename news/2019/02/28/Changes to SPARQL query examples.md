##Advanced search SPARQL queries

The following example queries have been added:

1. [NXQ\_00246](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00246) **Proteins which are enzymes catalyzing a reaction involving lipids** This is a federated query with Rhea.
2. [NXQ\_00247](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00247) **Proteins with a molecular weight less than 25 kDa** i.e. amenable to top-down LC-MS proteomics

The following queries have been modified:

1. [NXQ\_00069](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00069) **Proteins which are the substrate of protein kinase SYK** This query used to find SRC substrates. The query has also been extended to include :ptmInfo annotations.
