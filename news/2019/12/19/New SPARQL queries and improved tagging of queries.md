##New SPARQL queries

The following queries have been added:

1.	NXQ\_00258 **Proteins involved in diseases due to intronic variants with one selected publication**
2.	[NXQ\_00259](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00259) **Proteins involved in diseases with clinical manifestations that include long organs**
3.	NXQ\_00260 **Proteins with high-frequency missense variants involved in bacterial infection, with dbSNP identifiers and position on the canonical isoform**
4.	NXQ\_00265 **Retrieve all positional annotations at a given position on a neXtProt isoform**
5.	NXQ\_00266 **Proteins binding estradiol and/or similar molecules (substructure search with SMILES) and their associated GO_MF terms**
6.	NXQ\_00267 **Proteins binding estradiol and/or similar molecules (similarity search with SMILES), and their associated GO_MF terms**

All queries, other than NXQ\_00259, are found in the [SnorQL](https://snorql.nextprot.org/) interface. Queries NXQ\_00258, NXQ\_00259 and NXQ\_00260 are federated queries with [DisGenet](https://www.disgenet.org/), while queries NXQ\_00266 and NXQ\_00267 are federated queries with [IDSM](https://idsm.elixir-czech.cz/).

##Improved tagging of queries

All our SPARQL query examples have tags to allow users to retrieve all examples concerning a specific topic (i.e. &quot;3D structure&quot;). Redundant tags, as well tags considered too specific, have been removed. A few tags were renamed so as to better reflect what they refer to (i.e. &quot;annotation quality&quot; was replaced with &quot;quality&quot;). Finally, all SPARQL query examples were reviewed to ensure that they are appropriately tagged.
