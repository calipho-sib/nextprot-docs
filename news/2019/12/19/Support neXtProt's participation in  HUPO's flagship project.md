As essential reference knowledge bases for the HUPO [Human Proteome Project](https://hupo.org/human-proteome-project) (HPP), neXtprot and PeptideAtlas have been validating, annotating and integrating all the data generated.

We are actively preparing the next data release, due in February 2020, which will serve as reference for all HPP studies to be published in 2020. In addition, we have developed specific tools such as the [Peptide Uniqueness Checker](../tools/peptide-uniqueness-checker) and the [Protein digestion tool](../tools/protein-digestion) to assist HPP teams in planning experiments and analyzing results.

The estimated costs for the sustained participation of neXtProt to the HPP is about 70$ per user per year. Yet, there is no dedicated funding to support HPP-related activities. Please consider donating [here](https://hupo.org/Donate) to support neXtProtâ€™s participation in HUPO's flagship project. At a minimum we suggest $50, but a higher donation is gratefully received.
