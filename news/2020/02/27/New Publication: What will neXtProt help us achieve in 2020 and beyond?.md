##Expert opinion

The quantity and quality of the proteomics data generated across the world is providing a better picture of the diversity of the proteins found in human samples. The HUPO Human Proteome Project launched in 2010 promotes the standardization, access and reuse of this data, in order to make proteomics an integral part of multi-omics research. By acting as the reference knowledgebase for this project, neXtProt helps the community to identify and fill gaps in our knowledge of the human proteome.
