The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses from the _Coronaviridae_ family, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), share commonalities in the way they infect human cells: they both use human ACE2 ([NX\_Q9BYF1](https://www.nextprot.org/entry/NX_Q9BYF1/)) as receptor to attach to the surface of the targeted cell, and human protease TMPRSS2 ([NX\_O15393](https://www.nextprot.org/entry/NX_O15393/)) to fuse their membrane with the membrane of the human cell.

The new SPARQL query **NXQ\_00271** allows to explore in seconds the known polymorphisms located on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coding sequences, their frequencies in the human population, and how they can affect protein activity, structure, post-translational modifications, or viral binding properties. This query is found in the [SnorQL](https://snorql.nextprot.org/) interface.
