The following queries have been added:

1. NXQ\_00272 **Proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways with associated medical information**
2. NXQ\_00273 **Diseases/phenotypes associated with coding variants and associated publications for a given gene**
3. NXQ\_00274 **Proteins involved in coronaviruses/SARS-CoV-2 pathways that are expressed in lung according to RNAseq analysis and detected at high levels by IHC in at least one lung cell type**
4. NXQ\_00275 **Proteins involved in coronaviruses/SARS-CoV-2 pathways that are drug targets according to DrugBank**
5. NXQ\_00276 **Proteins targeted by chloroquine and their GOLD binary interactions with other human proteins**

Queries NXQ\_00272, NXQ\_00274, NXQ\_00275, and NXQ\_00276 retrieve human proteins related to coronaviruses/SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

Queries NXQ\_00272 and NXQ\_00274 are federated with [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways), query NXQ\_00273 with [DisGeNET](https://www.disgenet.org/) and queries NXQ\_00275 and NXQ\_00276 with DrugBank.

These queries are only found in the [SnorQL](https://snorql.nextprot.org/) interface.
