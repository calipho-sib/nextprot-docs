The following new queries retrieve human proteins related to coronaviruses/SARS-CoV-2 infection:

1. NXQ\_00272 **Proteins involved in coronaviruses/SARS-CoV-2 pathways with associated medical information**
2. NXQ\_00273 **Proteins involved in coronaviruses/SARS-CoV-2 pathways that are expressed in lung according to RNAseq analysis and detected at high levels by IHC in at least one lung cell type**
3. NXQ\_00274 **Proteins involved in coronaviruses/SARS-CoV-2 pathways that are drug targets according to DrugBank**
4. NXQ\_00275 **Proteins targeted by chloroquine and their GOLD binary interactions with other human proteins**

Queries NXQ\_00272, NXQ\_00273 and NXQ\_00274 are federated with [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways), while queries NXQ\_00274 and NXQ\_00275 are federated with DrugBank.

All of these queries are found in the [SnorQL](https://snorql.nextprot.org/) interface.
