At neXtProt, we're always looking to improve usability.

##Changes to the download

Until now, selecting the Download option in neXtProt directed you to our FTP site. However, you may have noticed that your browser no longer allows FTP access. While File Transfer Protocol (FTP) used to be the standard for viewing and downloading files via the Internet, browsers have been phasing out the use of FTP because of its security weaknesses and inability to encrypt traffic. In order to allow you to continue to view the directories and/or download files, we are providing an Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) solution at [https://download.nextprot.org](https://download.nextprot.org). This is the same protocol you use to view the neXtProt web site.
