There are currently 1669 entries which have no functional information (run the SPARQL query [NXQ\_00022](https://www.nextprot.org/proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00022) for the complete list). This corresponds to 8.2% of the entries in data release 2021-02-18. These entries lack any experimentally determined or predicted function.

In March 2018, the HUPO C-HPP consortium launched the [neXt-CP50 project](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30269496/), in which CP stands for “characterization of protein” and uPE1 refers to the uncharacterized PE1 proteins in neXtProt. These proteins have been identified with high confidence at the protein level (PE1), but are considered as functionally uncharacterized, that is, without any functional annotation or solely annotated with generic GO terms that are not linked to any specific function, such as protein binding, calcium binding, zinc binding, metal ion binding, identical protein binding, protein homo-oligomerization, or signal transduction. The neXt-CP50 project aims to characterize an initial 50 of these 1260 uPE1 proteins in 3 years.

In order to support this community effort to complete the human functional proteome, neXtProt has begun to host protein function predictions. As a first step, we provide predictions for 7 entries (NX_Q5T5N4, NX_Q96LI9, NX_C9JQI7, NX_Q9BPX7, NX_Q9BUV0, NX_H3BR10 and NX_Q6P2H8). In order to give credit to the submitter(s), we will link to their ORCID. **Until an online submission form is available, please [contact us](mailto:support@nextprot.org?subject=\[Function%20Prediction\]) to submit predictions for an entry.**

##Modified advanced search SPARQL queries

The following queries have been modified:

1. NXQ\_00104 **Proteins whose gene is on chromosome 21 with at least one disease annotation from Orphanet** The query has been modified to return the disease names.
2. NXQ\_00265 **Retrieve all positional annotations at a given position on a neXtProt isoform** The results now include phenotypic variation annotations.

The queries are found in the (SnorQL)[https://snorql.nextprot.org/] interface.
