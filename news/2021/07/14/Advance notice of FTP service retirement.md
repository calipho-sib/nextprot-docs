While FTP is a convenient data access mechanism, HTTPS transfers are designed to increase download performance and improve security. HTTPS based data retrievals offer comparable functionality to FTP and allow a user to maintain a single connection to a server that can be used for any number of simultaneous file extractions. 
 
The neXtProt FTP service ([ftp://ftp.nextprot.org/pub/](ftp://ftp.nextprot.org/pub/)) is expected to be retired September 30, 2021. Access to the same data has been made available since April 2021 through HTTPS at [https://download.nextprot.org/](https://download.nextprot.org/). The file structure in the HTTPS mirrors that of the FTP.
 
Please update your scripts and workflows accordingly.
