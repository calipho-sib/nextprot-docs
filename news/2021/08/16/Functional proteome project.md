Following a presentation at BOSC2021 on &quot;Completing the functional human proteome together!&quot;, attendees remarked on the absence of a project page. The new [functional proteome project](../about/functional-proteome-project) page explains the goal of the project, tracks its progress, provides the list of entries with a funtion prediction and indicates how the community can participate by submitting predictions for the function of human proteins to neXtProt.

##More protein function predictions

Predictions for 6 additional entries (NX_Q3SX64, NX_P0C7W6, NX_Q9BUT9, NX_A0PJX8, NX_Q8TCA0, NX_Q9BV19) are now online. This brings the total number of entries for which a function has been proposed to 22.
