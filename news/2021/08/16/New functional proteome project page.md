The new [functional proteome project](../about/functional-proteome-project) page explains the goal of the project, tracks its progress, provides the list of entries with a function prediction and indicates how you can participate by submitting predictions for the function of human proteins to neXtProt.

##More protein function predictions

Predictions for 5 additional entries (NX\_Q3SX64, NX\_Q9BUT9, NX\_A0PJX8, NX\_Q8TCA0, NX\_Q9BV19) are now online. This brings the total number of entries for which a function has been proposed to 21.
