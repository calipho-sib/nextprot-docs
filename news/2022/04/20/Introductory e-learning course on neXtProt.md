To facilitate access to bioinformatics training and introduce some basic principles to life scientists, clinicians and future bioinformaticians, SIB has developed several e-learning modules, which are freely accessible to all. The e-learning course **[neXtProt: Exploring human proteins](https://edu.sib.swiss/course/view.php?id=549)** is now online. In this 1 h course, you will learn _what_ type of information on human proteins is found in neXtProt, _where_ it comes from and _how_ it is organized in topic-specific entry views. Several typical examples of _uses_ of neXtProt will provide ideas on how to use neXtProt for your own research.
