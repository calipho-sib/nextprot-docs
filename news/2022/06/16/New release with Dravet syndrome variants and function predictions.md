This release, neXtProt data release 2022-MM-DD, incorporates new variants, bringing the total number of variants in neXtProt to ?. 

##Changes to the data

**New variants relevant to Dravet syndrome**

Dravet syndrome is a rare, lifelong form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life. The disease, also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI), can be caused by a genetic variation in the (SCN1A)[../entry/NX_P35498/medical] gene. A total of ? SCN1A variants were annotated by our team and integrated. Of these, ? cause Dravet syndrome whereas ? variants do not.

**New variants from patients**

Genetic variants which have been identified in patients but for which the causal relationship is not established were annotated by our team. A total of ? patient variants in ? entries were integrated. 

##New advanced search SPARQL queries

The following queries of interest to the Dravet community have been added:

• NXQ\_00295 **References for SCN1A variants causing Dravet syndrome** Clinicians should use this query to submit missing publications describing variants not found in neXtProt.
• NXQ\_00296 **Pathways in which SCN1A GOLD interactants are involved** This query may be of interest to scientists studying Dravet syndrome.

An additional query of interest to structural biologists has been added:

• NXQ\_00297 **PDB structures spanning the complete sequence of the mature protein**

to the (SNORQL)[https://snorql.nextprot.org/] interface.

##New predictions of protein functions

Function predictions for entries NX_ ... are now available. These were proposed by the University of Geneva Bachelor students who took part in the 2022 edition of the (Data mining for protein function prediction: Fonctionathon)[https://www.unige.ch/innovations-pedagogiques/innovations/fonctionathon] course.

The total number of entries for which one or more function(s) have been predicted is now ?. All entries with function predictions are listed in the (functional proteome project)[https://www.nextprot.org/about/functional-proteome-project] page.
