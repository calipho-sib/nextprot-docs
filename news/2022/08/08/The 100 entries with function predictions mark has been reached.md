On [April 28, 2021](../news/new-community-function-predictions), neXtProt began to host protein function predictions to support the HUPO C-HPP consortium effort to complete the human functional proteome. At the time, predictions for 7 entries were made available. The **functional proteome project** [page](../about/functional-proteome-project) explains the goal of the project, tracks its progress, and indicates how you can participate by submitting predictions for the function of human proteins to neXtProt.

In the meantime, we published a manual data mining workflow to generate functional hypotheses for uncharacterized human proteins  and its application by undergraduate students ([doi: 10.1093/database/baab046](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baab046)). The neXtProt team and the University of Geneva students who took the Functionathon course continued proposing function predictions for human proteins.

**neXtProt now has a total of n entries for which a function has been proposed.** The list of entries is found [here](../proteins/search?listId=RGGSN4W1). There is still a long way to go - [these](../proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00022) 1,557 entries have no function annotated in the current 2022-05-19 neXtProt release.

**Help us keep going!** Weâ€™re calling on all annotators and bioinformaticians to submit predictions or additional evidence supporting the predictions. If you are a web lab scientist, please test the predictions experimentally to advance our knowledge on the human proteome.
