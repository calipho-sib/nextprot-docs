##SVG export of positional features

The graphical interface of the feature viewer has been improved so that users can download a .svg image of the positional features they are exploring.

##Improved traceability of function predictions

All our function predictions are associated with ECO terms reflecting the type of analysis that was performed. These ECO terms are now complemented with the name of the 
species in which the analysis was perfomed.

Example: [TMEM 53 predictions](../entry/NX_Q6P2H8/function-predictions)

##New SPARQL query

The query **NXQ_00300** available on [the SNORQL interface] (https://snorql.nextprot.org/), retrieves all human proteins with protein existence "At protein level" (PE=1) 
that have no function annotated, are highly expressed in brain and have homologs in Drosophila melanogaster according to OrthoDB. 
It is federated with [OrthoDB] (https://www.orthodb.org/) :<br>
