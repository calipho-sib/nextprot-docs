Abstract 

To help researchers identify uncharacterized human genes that can be investigated using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, a new query federated
between neXtProt and OrthoDB has been added on the neXtProt platform (NXQ_00300). The output of this query shows that there are 44 uncharacterized genes
highly expressed in the human brain for which a homolog is found in Drosophila melanogaster.
