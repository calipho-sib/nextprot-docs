Check out the *Data in use* [paper-46](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3415/paper-46.pdf) by Lydie Lane, Kasun Samarasinghe and Pierre-Andr√© Michel, that describes the query NXQ_00300, available on the SNORQL interface.

## Abstract 

To help researchers identify uncharacterized human genes that can be investigated using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, a new query federated
between neXtProt and OrthoDB has been added on the neXtProt platform (NXQ_00300). The output of this query shows that there are 44 uncharacterized genes
highly expressed in the human brain for which a homolog is found in Drosophila melanogaster.
