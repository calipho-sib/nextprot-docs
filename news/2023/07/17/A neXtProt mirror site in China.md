China's growing scientific research strength, notably in the proteomics field, has led to an increasing demand for Chinese scholars to access the neXtProt database. As the server load is getting heavier, the performances and speed of the www.nextprot.org server for users located in China are suboptimal.

Chi-Biotech's main business is related to large-scale sequencing and it is well known in the industry due to its FANSe series of high-precision sequencing comparison algorithms and translatome sequencing services (including RNC-seq and Ribo-seq). Chi-Biotech is also very much involved in the proteomics field and has a long-term collaboration with HUPO.

[Chi-Biotech](http://www.chi-biotech.com/) and neXtProt joined their forces and are happy to deliver a mirror site of neXtProt in China, www.nextprot.cn.

This mirror site should considerably improve the usability of neXtProt for users located in China and other Asian countries.
