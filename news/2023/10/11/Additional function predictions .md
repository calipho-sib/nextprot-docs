Function predictions were added for **12 proteins**, bringing the total number of entries with predictions to 244 out of the [1,521](https://www.nextprot.org/proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00022) entries that have no function annotated in the current release. The list is [here]( https://www.nextprot.org/proteins/search?listId=VOLWSIK5).


**Help us reach the 500 entry mark!** We're calling on all annotators and bioinformaticians to submit predictions or additional evidence supporting the predictions. We're also eager to have web lab scientists test the predictions experimentally and publish the results to help us advance our knowledge of the human proteome.
