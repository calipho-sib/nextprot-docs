New function predictions
Function predictions, compiled from 65 articles and bioinformatics tools, were added for 39 proteins. This brings the total number of entries with predictions to 239, out of the 1,521 entries that have no function annotated in the current release. The list is here.

Help us reach the 500 entry mark! We're calling on all annotators and bioinformaticians to submit predictions or additional evidence supporting the predictions. We're also eager to have web lab scientists test the predictions experimentally and publish the results to help us advance our knowledge of the human proteome.
