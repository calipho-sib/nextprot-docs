Dear neXtProt Users,

You have probably noticed that our last release dates to Autumn 2023. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, we will not be able to provide any update in 2024, and neXtProt in its current form will be discontinued at the end of the year.

For the past 12 years, neXtProt has played a central role in the HUPO proteomics community, integrating data from HPA, PeptideAtlas, and Massive, and computing the annual metrics for the Human Proteome Project (HPP). These tasks have now been taken over by UniProt.

Despite these changes, we remain passionate about serving the scientific community. We are eager to contribute our expertise in data modeling and semantics, assigning functions to poorly characterized proteins, and understanding how genetic variations can alter protein properties and contribute to diseases.

As our production release cycle is on hold, we would like to take this opportunity to rethink our priorities and explore solutions to ensure neXtProt can continue in some form, whether through relocation, recycling of components, or other means. We welcome your input! If you have fresh ideas on how our expertise and data models could benefit your projects or suggestions for sustainable paths forward for neXtProt, please contact us at [support@nextprot.org](mailto:support@nextprot.org).

Wishing you a pleasant summer break,
The neXtProt team
