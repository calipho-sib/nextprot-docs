While knowledge on human proteins has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years with high-throughput experiments and simulations, there are still many proteins lacking any experimentally determined or predicted function. In order to support the community effort initiated by the HUPO C-HPP consortium (1) to **complete the human functional proteome**, neXtProt has begun to host and contribute (2) protein function predictions. 

##Tracking the progress of the project

In the current neXtProt release there are:

* ${ENTRY_COUNT} entries
* ${PROTEIN_WITH_NO_FUNCTION_ANNOTATED_COUNT} proteins with no function annotated
* 22 entries with a function prediction

##Function prediction submissions

Join neXtProt in the community effort to complete the human functional proteome! It's as easy as 1-2-3.

Step 1. Pick a **protein with no function annotated** by running the following SPARQL query [NXQ\_00022](https://www.nextprot.org/proteins/search?mode=advanced&queryId=NXQ_00022).

Step 2. Here is the **current list of entries with a function prediction**:

* [NX\_Q5T5N4](../entry/NX_Q5T5N4/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q96LI9](../entry/NX_Q96LI9/function-predictions)
* [NX\_C9JQI7](../entry/NX_C9JQI7/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q9BPX7](../entry/NX_Q9BPX7/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q9BUV0](../entry/NX_Q9BUV0/function-predictions)
* [NX\_H3BR10](../entry/NX_H3BR10/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q6P2H8](../entry/NX_Q6P2H8/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q53EV4](../entry/NX_Q53EV4/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q8IYE0](../entry/NX_Q8IYE0/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q8N5R6](../entry/NX_Q8N5R6/function-predictions)
* [NX\_P0DPI2](../entry/NX_P0DPI2/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q8N4L1](../entry/NX_Q8N4L1/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q8IW70](../entry/NX_Q8IW70/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q6UWF7](../entry/NX_Q6UWF7/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q8N323](../entry/NX_Q8N323/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q96DL1](../entry/NX_Q96DL1/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q3SX64](../entry/NX_Q3SX64/function-predictions)
* [NX\_P0C7W6](../entry/NX_P0C7W6/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q9BUT9](../entry/NX_Q9BUT9/function-predictions)
* [NX\_A0PJX8](../entry/NX_A0PJX8/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q8TCA0](../entry/NX_Q8TCA0/function-predictions)
* [NX\_Q9BV19](../entry/NX_Q9BV19/function-predictions)

Similar or different hypotheses for these proteins are welcome.

Step 3. Send us an [e-mail](mailto:support@nextprot.org) with the accession number of the entry, the proposed function(s) of the protein (preferably GO terms), the type of evidence to support the function(s) (preferably ECO terms) and whenever possible the associated papers, as well as your ORCID number and the paper in which the functional hypothesis has been published, if applicable. Please make sure that the proposed function(s) is/are sufficiently precise to be testable by experimental researchers.

We will post your function prediction with the hope that they will be experimentally confirmed in the not too distant future.
