#Known issues

This new neXtProt search site is a work in progress. We are aware of the following issues:

 - You currently can not download sequences in FASTA or PEFF format
 - In the simple search you can't search for a publication DOI or an isoform alternative name
 - You can create a list containing invalid accession numbers
 - Lists with UniProt ACs cannot be viewed or combined with other lists
 
The current version of the XML is not fully mature, in particular:

 - There is currently no XSD
 - The section on protein and gene names is not yet finalized and will undergo a number of changes
 - The information on the gene chromosomal location, length, exons and transcripts are not exported
 - The ChEMBL, IPI and MIM identifiers are not exported
 
Please let us know of any other issues that you may encounter while using this neXtProt search tool.
