#Known issues

This new neXtProt search site is a work in progress. We are aware of the following issues:

 - You currently can not download sequences in FASTA or PEFF format
 - In the simple search you can't search for a publication DOI or an isoform alternative name
 - The simple search autocomplete is often concatenating words and is acting weird if the query input in in upper case 
 
The current version of the XML is not fully mature, in particular:

 - There is currently no XSD
 - The section on protein and gene names is not yet finalized and will undergo a number of changes
 - The information on the gene chromosomal location, length, exons and transcripts are not exported
 - The ChEMBL and IPI identifiers are not exported
 
Please let us know of any other issues that you may encounter while using the next neXtProt search tool
