#Known issues

This new neXtProt search site is a work in progress. We are aware of the following issues:

 - You currently can not download sequences in PEFF format
 - In the simple search you can't search for a publication DOI or an isoform alternative name
 
The current version of the XML is not fully mature, in particular:

 - There is currently no XSD
 - Additional publications are not exported
 
Please let us know of any other issues that you may encounter while using this neXtProt search tool.
