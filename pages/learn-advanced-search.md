#Advanced search

Select the **Advanced** option below the query box to use the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) to access all the neXtProt protein entry data.

Select _Snorql_ from the Resources menu to view the underlying **Data model**.

##Query list

We provide a set of sample queries which exemplify the type of searches that can be performed. Feel free to use these as templates for your own queries. These queries, as well as any queries you have saved, are displayed in a pop-up window when first accessing the advanced search. From this query list window, you can:

* **scroll** up or down to browse the sample queries.
* use the pre-defined tags in the drop-down **Tags** menu to retrieve a subset of examples. Start over by selecting *Clear filter*.
* **search** for words in the sample queries by entering these in the search box.

To close the query list window, simply click on the "x" on the top right of the window. This window can be accessed at any time from the advanced search by clicking on the **query list** icon in the search box.

##Managing queries

* **Viewing queries** In the query list window, click on the description of a query to view it, including the comments, explanations and the tags associated with it. Simply click on **Run this query!** to view the results. To return to the query list, click on the **query list** icon at the top left of the window.
* **Editing queries** Queries must be in the search box in order to be edited. In the query list window or while viewing a query, click the **put the query in the search box** icon. 
* **Running queries** Once your query is in the search box, click on Search. As with the simple search, the search results can be sorted and filtered.
