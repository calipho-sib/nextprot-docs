As this API is in the process of being phased out, it is missing some variants and mutageneses for the entries BRCA1, BRCA2, EPCAM, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN4A, SCN5A, SCN8A, SCN9A, SCN10A, and SCN11A.

We strongly encourage users to start using our new API at https://api.nextprot.org/ and to provide feedback to support@nextprot.org
