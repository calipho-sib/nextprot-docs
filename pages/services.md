##Testimonials
   
_**HUPO**_<br>
Gil Omenn, Leader of the HUPO HPP project<br>
&quot;The combination of neXtProt, PeptideAtlas, ProteomeXchange/PRIDE, and interchange with other resources internationally has greatly accelerated the field of proteomics. (…) Reliable, fully shared and reconfirmed data with tools like the TransProteomicPipeline, neXtProt uniqueness mapper, the Universal Spectra Identifier, and the SRM Atlas and Popular Proteins lists can accelerate biological and clinical applications from the HPP and the community at large.&quot;

_**ENYO Pharma SA**_<br>
Laurène Meyniel-Schicklin, Co-Founder<br>
&quot;The collaboration allowed us to make the protein-protein interaction data from ENYO easily discoverable to all, through the fantastic knowledge platform dedicated to human proteins that is neXtProt. We are happy to contribute to enabling their use by all researchers studying and interpreting protein networks in health and disease.&quot;
